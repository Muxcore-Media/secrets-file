# Contributing to Secrets File Vault

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26.x
- golangci-lint (optional but recommended)

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone ssh://forgejo@git.zem.systems:2222/muxcore/secrets-file.git
cd secrets-file
go build -o secrets-file ./cmd/module
```

### Run against a local muxcored

```bash
# Terminal 1: start core in dev mode
cd ../core
MUXCORE_INSECURE_DISABLE_TLS=true ./muxcored

# Terminal 2: start module
export SECRETS_MASTER_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export SECRETS_KEY_FILE=/tmp/secrets-file-master.key
export SECRETS_STORE=/tmp/secrets-file.json
go build -o secrets-file ./cmd/module
./secrets-file --muxcore-mesh-addr localhost:9090
```

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

Tests must not depend on a running muxcored instance. Use mocks where needed.

## Linting

```bash
make lint
```

## Code Conventions

- No comments explaining what the code does — name things well instead.
- Comments only for non-obvious WHY — hidden invariants, workarounds.
- No `os.Exit` from library code — only `main` exits.
- Structured logging via `log/slog` — no `fmt.Println` in non-test code.
- Context propagation — every function that does I/O takes `ctx context.Context` as its first argument.
- Error wrapping — use `fmt.Errorf("operation %q: %w", name, err)`.
